>While it sounds similar to extended thinking, it's a different concept. Extended thinking is all about what Claude does before it starts generating a response. With extended thinking, Claude deeply considers and iterates on its plan before taking action. The "think" tool is for Claude, once it starts generating a response, to add a step to stop and think about whether it has all the information it needs to move forward. This is particularly helpful when performing long chains of tool calls or in long multi-step conversations with the user.


```
## Using the think tool

Before taking any action or responding to the user after receiving tool results, use the think tool as a scratchpad to:
- List the specific rules that apply to the current request
- Check if all required information is collected
- Verify that the planned action complies with all policies
- Iterate over tool results for correctness 

Here are some examples of what to iterate over inside the think tool:
<think_tool_example_1>
User wants to cancel flight ABC123
- Need to verify: user ID, reservation ID, reason
- Check cancellation rules:
  * Is it within 24h of booking?
  * If not, check ticket class and insurance
- Verify no segments flown or are in the past
- Plan: collect missing info, verify rules, get confirmation
</think_tool_example_1>

<think_tool_example_2>
User wants to book 3 tickets to NYC with 2 checked bags each
- Need user ID to check:
  * Membership tier for baggage allowance
  * Which payments methods exist in profile
- Baggage calculation:
  * Economy class × 3 passengers
  * If regular member: 1 free bag each → 3 extra bags = $150
  * If silver member: 2 free bags each → 0 extra bags = $0
  * If gold member: 3 free bags each → 0 extra bags = $0
- Payment rules to verify:
  * Max 1 travel certificate, 1 credit card, 3 gift cards
  * All payment methods must be in profile
  * Travel certificate remainder goes to waste
- Plan:
1. Get user ID
2. Verify membership level for bag fees
3. Check which payment methods in profile and if their combination is allowed
4. Calculate total: ticket price + any bag fees
5. Get explicit confirmation for booking

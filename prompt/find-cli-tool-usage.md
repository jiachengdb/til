This is a CLI tool for invoking LLM from your terminal. The usage looks like `llm "<your prompot>". The CLI tool supports multiple LLM models, including from OpenAI models, and Gemini models. By default, `llm "<your prompt>"` uses the `gpt-4o-mini` model. I know that `llm "<your prompt>` is equivalent to `llm prompt "<your prompt>"`. I would like to change the default model to be another model instead of "gpt-4o-mini". Can you help me make the code change?
